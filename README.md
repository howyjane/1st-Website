First Coding Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my first coding project. In this project I have created a new website for a start-up consultancy firm which provides advisory and consultancy for 2 investment products : Gold ETFS and Gold Futures. 

Investors/Non-Investors can visit the website to find out more about who we are, our offerings and what's trending in the Gold ETFs and Gold Futures Market. We hope to attract members of the public who  who are curious about Gold ETFs and Gold Futures and looking for assistance with these 2 investment products.
